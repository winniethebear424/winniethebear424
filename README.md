Driven and self-motivated professional with a strong foundation in software development and product management. With over 2 years of experience as a Technical Project Manager at HUAWEI, I've successfully led App Optimization initiatives that have left a lasting impact, resulting in significant improvements in user satisfaction (80% YOY increase) and substantial sales revenue growth (200%+ MOM increase) for organizations at scale.

I'm currently honored to serve as a Women Techmaker Ambassador at Google, where I'm actively involved in advancing women's participation and influence in the world of technology.
